Research Objectives:
The objective of this research is to analyze the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset and extract meaningful insights that can help restaurants improve their offerings and stay ahead of their competitors.

Research Questions:
The research will make an effort to respond to the following questions:
How does a restaurant's pricing affect its rankings and reviews from customers?

Do restaurants that deliver food online receive better ratings and more ratings than those that don't?

What are the most common complaints and issues raised in restaurant reviews in Bangalore, and how do these vary by cuisine type and price range?

Are there any notable trends or patterns in the data that suggest opportunities for new restaurant concepts or innovations in the Bangalore market?

Going forward we may add a few more questions and try to resolve those.
