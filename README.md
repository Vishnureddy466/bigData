3. a) Business Problem or Opportunity for Renewable Energy and Weather Conditions:
The business problem is to optimize the usage of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly important as we transition away from fossil fuels, but they are also intermittent, meaning that their output can vary depending on weather conditions. This variability can make it difficult to integrate renewable energy sources into the grid and meet demand for electricity.

Domain Knowledge:
Due to worries about climate change and the need to minimize greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy is becoming more and more significant in today's society. Renewable energy generation can be significantly impacted by environmental factors like wind and sun irradiation. To use renewable energy sources as efficiently as possible, it is critical to have a solid understanding of how these variables relate to one another.

Research Objectives:
Identify patterns and trends in renewable energy production based on weather conditions.
Predict renewable energy production based on weather conditions.
Optimize the usage of renewable energy sources based on weather conditions.
Investigate the impact of different weather conditions on renewable energy production.

Research Questions:
What is the relationship between solar power production and temperature?
How does wind speed affect wind power production?
Can we predict solar power production based on weather conditions?
How can we optimize the usage of renewable energy sources based on weather conditions?

3. b) Business Problem or Opportunity for Zomato Bangalore Restaurants:
The restaurant business is extremely competitive, and restaurants are constantly seeking methods to enhance their offerings and stay ahead of the competition. Understanding the customer preferences, trying to identify popular cuisines and locales, and analyzing pricing and user reviews can all provide useful insights that can assist restaurants in making data-driven decisions.
 
Domain Knowledge: 
The following domains can be used to evaluate and translate the information in the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset:
 
Restaurant sector: While evaluating the dataset, understanding the restaurant industry and the variables that affect a restaurant's success, such as location, pricing, menu, and customer service, can be very helpful.
